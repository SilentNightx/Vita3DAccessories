# VitaStand v2
VitaStand is a kickstand for 1000 series PlayStation Vitas with the remote play grip (https://www.amazon.com/PSVITA1000-buttons-mounted-Answer-PS-VETA/dp/B0191F6L1G/). V2 screws into the top of the grip with 2mm screws which looks much nicer than V1. Now the stand sticks to the console and will even stay down when not using it. The stand snap fits into the mount.
