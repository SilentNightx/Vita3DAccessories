VitaStand is a kickstand for 1000 series PlayStation Vitas with the remote play grip (https://www.amazon.com/PSVITA1000-buttons-mounted-Answer-PS-VETA/dp/B0191F6L1G/). V1 requires cutting into the grip. I did this by melting away the plastic with a soldering iron. This method doesn't look nice but it works.
