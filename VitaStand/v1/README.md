# VitaStand v1
VitaStand is a kickstand for 1000 series PlayStation Vitas with the remote play grip (https://www.amazon.com/PSVITA1000-buttons-mounted-Answer-PS-VETA/dp/B0191F6L1G/). V1 requires cutting into the grip. I did this by melting away the plastic with a soldering iron. This method doesn't look nice but it works. Don't try this if you want to keep your grip in mint condition. There are probably better ways to do this.
